This program will help you master systems of linear equations for your upcoming exam.

### What is a System of Linear Equations?
A **system of linear equations** consists of two or more linear equations with the same variables. 
The solution is the point(s) where all equations are simultaneously true.

### Three Solution Methods You Need to Know:
1. **Graphing** - Visual method to find intersection
2. **Substitution** - Algebraic method when one variable is isolated
3. **Elimination** - Algebraic method by adding/subtracting equations

        2. Substitute that expression into the other equation
        3. Solve for the remaining variable
        4. Substitute back to find the other variable
